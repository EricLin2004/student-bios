###Bio

Hi - My name is Anthony and I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2010 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. My first job out of college was as an automation test engineer at Wells Fargo. I had not had much programming experience beforehand, so everyday was filled with amazing learning experiences. During my time there, I had mastered automation scripting languages such as watir, watir-webdriver, and selenium-webdriver as well as introduced new technologies and automated mobile testing solutions to many groups within Wells Fargo.

Learning to script was just the tip of the iceberg and I had started to teach myself rails using Hartl's tutorial. However, this was not cutting it as I was not progressing at the velocity I wanted. That's where AppAcademy came in and attending AppAcademy has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. It is amazing how clear rails and web development concepts are to me now in just 9 weeks. 
However, the learning doesn't stop after these 9 weeks and will never stop as technology improves. I want to expand my skill set and am looking for a team where I can add value and improve in conjunction with them.
